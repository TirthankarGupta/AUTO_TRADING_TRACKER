## Date: 2025-09-11 (Night Session)

### ✅ Achievements
1. **Data Fetching**
   - Successfully downloaded NIFTY 1-min OHLCV data via yfinance.
   - Cleaned and normalized columns for backtesting.

2. **Backtesting Engine**
   - Replaced with robust acktest.py.
   - Strategy logic: **EMA 9/21 crossover + RSI filter + VWAP trend**.
   - Captures **entry/exit reasons** for every trade.
   - Outputs to data/backtest_results.csv.

3. **Results**
   - Backtest ran successfully (≈ 52 trades).
   - Summary includes total trades, win rate, average P&L, etc.

4. **Visualization**
   - Added plot_results.py.
   - Generates:
     - Equity curve (cumulative P&L).
     - Biggest win/loss markers.
     - P&L distribution histogram.
     - Drawdown chart.

### 📌 Current Status
- Full pipeline working: **Fetch → Clean → Backtest → Analyze → Visualize**.
- First real milestone achieved in backtesting framework.

### 🚀 Next Steps
- Add more performance metrics (Sharpe, Sortino, Max DD %).
- Generate automated PDF/Excel trade journal reports.
- Prepare Angel One SmartAPI integration (once TOTP/password issue is resolved).
